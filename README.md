# ServerBot

Super simple and quick bot (written in half an hour) that can give info on preset minecraft servers. I plan to go upgrade the looks of it at a later date... mostly just wrote it because I'm too lazy to boot up the game to see what servers people are logged into.

To set it up for yourself, just input the bot token next to the comment I put (in the Bot class) and also input the information for all the servers into the server list. There is a template for how to add them included as well. Then just compile the code into a jar and run it.

This github link was directly copied into this project to handle connection with the actual minecraft server: https://gist.github.com/zh32/7190955
